## Learning Objectives
- Define __Cloud Computing__
- Describe the __Essential Characteristics__ of cloud computing
- Briefly recount the __History and Evolution__ of cloud computing
- Describe the key considerations that organizations can use as a guide while creating their __Cloud Strategy__
- Describe the __Key Cloud Service Providers__ and their services
- Create an account on a public cloud platform
<br>

## Definition and Characteristics
- __Definition__
    - the delivery of on-demand computing resources (everything from applications to data centers) over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.
    - NIST's definition
        - a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
        - Examples of computing resources: networks, servers, storage, applications, services 
- __5 Characteristics__
    - On-demand Self-service
    - Broad Network Access
    - Resource Pooling
    - Rapid Elasticity
    - Meausred Service
        - CaaS(Cloud Computing as a Service): more cost-efficient, more agile to market change
- __3 Depyloment Models__ : Public, Private, Hybrid
- __3 Service Models__
    - IaaS _(Infrastructure as a Service)_
    - PaaS _(Platform as a Service)_
    - SaaS _(Software as a Service )_
        - "on-demand software."
<br>

## History and Evolution
- __History__ : shared access(1950's) > virtual machine(1970's)
- __Virtualization__
    - Hypervisor _(or virtual machine monitor, VMM)_ <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85097554-d3d0b200-b232-11ea-9f8c-9240298c546d.PNG" width="300"></p>
- __Pay-as-you-go__ _(or utility computing model)_
    - Switch from 'Capital Expense' to 'Operating Expense'
<br>

## Key Considerations
- __Key Drivers for Moving to Cloud__
    - Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness
- __4 Key Considerations__
    - Infrastructure and Workloads
    - SaaS and development platforms _(leasing or buying?)_
    - Speed and Productivity
    - Risk Exposure
- __Benefits of Cloud Adoption__
    - Flexibility _(+security)_
    - Efficiency
    - Strategic Value
- __Challenges of Cloud Adoption__ <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85097954-1c3c9f80-b234-11ea-9d88-6631ea972876.PNG" width="400"></p>
<br>

## Key Service Providers
- __Future of Clouding Computing__
    - The question is “what” their cloud adoption strategy should be to best serve their businesses and customers.
- __Cloud Service Proviers__
    - IBM Cloud
        - a full stack cloud platform that spans public, private, and hybrid environments
with products and services <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85098374-77bb5d00-b235-11ea-82d9-09543a16252f.PNG" width="300"></p>
    - Alibaba Cloud _(Aliyun)_
    - AWS _(Amazon Web Services)_
    - GCP _(Google Cloud Platform)_ - Youtube
    - MS Azure
    - Oracle Cloud
    - Salesforce
- __SAP__: Enterprise software and applications such as ERP, CRM, HR, and Finance, running in the cloud.

## Module Summary
- Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; <br>resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.
- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.
- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.
- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services.
- Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
