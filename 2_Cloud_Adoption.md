## Learning Objectives
- Describe the __business case for cloud adoption__ and case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting cloud
- Explain how emerging technologies such as the __IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Analytics are being accelerated by the Cloud__
<br>

## Cloud Adoption - No longer a choice
- __IBM Institute for Business Value study__
    - more than three-quarters of enterprises today are using cloud computing to expand into new industries.
    - 74% have adopted cloud to improve customer experience
    - 71% use cloud to create enhanced products and services, <br>while simultaneously downsizing legacy systems and reducing costs.
- __IDC _(The International Data Corporation)_ Prediction__
    - by 2025, the total amount of digital data created worldwide will rise to 163 zettabytes (one zettabyte == a trillion gigabytes).
    - 30% of this data will be real-time information.

<br>

## Cloud Adoption - Some case studies
- __American Airlines__ _(better customer service)_
    - New cloud-based technology platform
- __UBank__ _(removing barriers to innovation)_
    - Virtual assistant using IBM Watson technology to support the bank's online home loan application
    - PaaS cloud development model _(demand for enterprise scale)_
- __Bitly__
    - Establish scalable hosting platform
- __ActivTrades__ _(accelerating growth)_
    - Migrate three major trading system to IBM Cloud for VMware solutions
    - Back data storage, networking, & security on IBM Cloud
<br>

## Internet of Things on the Cloud
- __IoT__
    - giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how we live our daily lives.
    - smart devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data.<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85102578-eb626780-b23f-11ea-9b27-f0b64680d6b0.PNG" width="300"></p>
- __IoT on Cloud__
    - for device registration
    - for device identity
    - for storing data
    - for accessing enterprise data
    - for backend analytics
    - for development speed-up
- __Case__
    - IoT on the cloud to combat the poaching of endangered rhinos at Welgevonden by making poaching predictable.
        - Animals are wearing IoT sensors connected to the IBM cloud.
        - When poachers enter the area, the animals run for it, which alerts Rangers who can track their emotions and help stop them before any harm is done.
<br>

## Artificial Intelligence on the Cloud
- __Symbiotic Relationship among AI, IoT, and Cloud__
    - IoT delivers the data
    - AI powers the insights
    - both leverage cloud’s scalability and processing power in real time.<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85103754-3d0bf180-b242-11ea-83e6-df3a95084c05.PNG" width="300"></p>
- __Case__
    - AI Highlights uses Watson to process thousands of hours of US Open video and analyzes match videos
    - gives fans deep insight into featured matches, and it can see the momentum of a match shifting
<br>

## Blockchain and Analytics on the Cloud
- __Blockchain__
    - a secure, distributed, open technology that can help speed up processes, lower costs, and build transparency and traceability in transactional applications.
    - immutable Network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
- __3-Way Relationship among Blockchain, AI and Cloud__
    - Blockchain serves to make AI more understandable by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made in an AI algorithm
    - leads to greater trust and transparency in the conclusions and decisions made by these algorithms <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60066472/85104533-be17b880-b243-11ea-91e8-3f47b1f65fa8.PNG" width="450"></p>
- __Case__
    - farmers in Salinas are able to track our product within seconds
    - consumers have instant access where the product came from, in case there's any recall.
- __Analytics on Cloud__
    - Track trends on social media to predict future events
    - Analyze data to build machine learning models in cognitive applications
    - Data analytics and predictive maintenance solutions for city infrastructure
    - Case: KONE, eleveator manufacture
        - predict failure rate to a certain percentage that is about to happen in the future for our equipment
        - equipment is connected to the cloud and monitored.
<br>

## Module Summary
- The adoption of cloud technologies is enabling enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive, and to create differentiated customer experiences. The question organizations are asking is not whether they should move to the cloud, rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.
- Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting cloud
    - American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise
    - UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers thereby removing barriers to innovation
    - Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically disbursed enterprise customers
    - ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers
- Emerging technologies, powered by the cloud, are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.
- Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world.
- The use of the Internet of Things on the cloud to combat poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa
- Artificial Intelligence on the cloud being leveraged to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world by the United States Tennis Association
- Blockchain on the cloud helping farmers reduce waste by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain
